## Welcome!
Hello! Welcome to the README of our final project.

To start, you will need to download the data from Kaggle here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sherrytp/airline-delay-analysis

The data files should be in the same folder as the notebook in order to run.

The data used for this project spans 2015 through 2019.

## WARNING!

The data files are very large and the notebook takes up roughly 75GB of RAM to run, despite thorough memory management in the code.

## How to:

Overall the notebook is heavily commented and guides readers through the project.
